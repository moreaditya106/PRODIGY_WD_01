# PRODIGY_WD_01

This repository contains the code for the first task of my Prodigy Infotech internship. The task involves creating an interactive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a responsive and interactive navigation menu that:
- Remains fixed at the top of the page.
- Changes color when the page is scrolled.
- Changes the style of menu items when hovered over.

## Files in this Repository

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the webpage.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the navigation menu and other elements.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity, such as changing the background color of the navigation bar on scroll.

## How to Use
